These are the steps you must take before you can call the **rec-hockey-service**.

Expect this preparation to take about 30 minutes to complete.

## Preparing your system

These are the requirements:

1. A development system (PC, Mac, or Linux) running a current or
long-term support (LTS) version of the operating system.
2. A [GitHub account](https://github.com)
3. [Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git) (for the command line)
4. A current/LTS version of `node.js`
5. A current version of [json-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server)
6. The [Postman desktop app](https://www.postman.com/downloads/). Because you run the **rec-hockey-service** on your development system with an `http://localhost` hostname, the web-version of Postman can't perform the exercises.
7. A fork of the [rec-hockey-service repo](https://github.com/nemethconsulting/uw-rhs)
8. A current copy of the database file. (You can get this by syncing your fork).
9. (Optional) [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com)

Once you have all these, you are ready to [Test your system](test-system.md)
